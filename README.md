# Absences
This program I wrote for fun. It is a presentation of real crystalographics cell and its reciprocal space representation. Unfortunatly, the mecanism for reading symmetry transformations is not fully corect. The proper one can be found in Cif program in one of my repositories.

The program uses Space groups symetries to generate unit cell (with three bals) and reciprocal space. 
To star the program you need VS2019 redistributables
For graphics the program uses MonoGame framework.
Compiled with VS 2019

What you can do with this:
Create your own crystallographic unit cell wit a,b,c, alph, bet, gam parameters
Select one of the 233 symetries to generate filling of the unit cell
Rotate, zoom, shift both real and reciprocal space
observe the absences in reciprocal space according to used symmetry
Have a fun!
